Using the [Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTZf6XIYPLjxmCS8BzzEot1DaW4ns7P2q1CVqnZ6qw9f-A3bkCPbXX3H9vOE2_zrGKSxy4ZMaTf7lt4/pub?gid=594194017&single=true&output=csv), which has 32 columns and 569 rows, to predict whether a tumor cell is malignant (m) or benign (b).

# Objectives
Create the best classification model to evaluate the data.

# Task
To build the best model to diagnose cancer and report on results.

# Key Insights
1. Among the six models measured, logreg model has the highest accuracy .979.

2. What are false positive and false negative? Which one is worse in this set?
- false positives: also known as type 1 error. An example of this is that people diagnosed with cancer but in reality they do not have cancer.

- false negatives: also known as type 2 error as this is definitely worse since it suggests people with cancer but it was not diagnosed
